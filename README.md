# Data-Mining-Project
Businesses that claim their target audience to be “pretty much everybody” or “anyone interested” exhibit diminishing economic growth. Identification of right customers helps a business in its crucial decision-making process and its success and survival. Finding a target audience is a challenge as it is influenced by various factors. These factors include personal preferences, geographical convenience, and business reputation. Taking into account these factors, we devised an ensemble approach which includes collaborative methods such as ALS, KNN, and Cross Recommendation to capture user’s personal preferences coupled with Location and Category based recommendation system which captures Geographical Convenience.
